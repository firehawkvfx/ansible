  ### steps to creat a new user rwith password and ssh key

  - name: Ensure group "deadlineuser" exists
    group:
      name: deadlineuser
      state: present
      gid: 9001

  - name: Add the user 'deadlineuser' with a specific uid and a primary group of 'deadlineuser'
    user:
      name: deadlineuser
      comment: A user for rendering operations.
      groups: # Empty by default, here we give it some groups
        - wheel
        - deadlineuser
      uid: 9001

  - name: set user pass centos
    expect:
      command: passwd centos
      responses:
        (?i)password: "{{ user_deadlineuser_pw }}"
        (?i)Retype new password: "{{ user_deadlineuser_pw }}"
    
  - name: set user pass deadlineuser
    expect:
      command: passwd deadlineuser
      responses:
        (?i)password: "{{ user_deadlineuser_pw }}"
        (?i)Retype new password: "{{ user_deadlineuser_pw }}"

  - name: adding a new user requires a restart of pcoip service if present
    shell: |
      systemctl restart pcoip
    become: true
    when: pcoip

  - name: setup ssh key for deadline user by generating key identifier from pem key
    shell: |
      ssh-keygen -y -f {{ local_key_path }} > /home/deployuser/{{ key_name }}_public
    connection: local
    become_user: deployuser

  ### we create a group to ensure that both deadlineuser and centos user have permissions on show paths in the future.

  - name: Ensure group "syscontrol" exists
    group:
      name: syscontrol
      state: present
      gid: 9003
    become: true

  - name: adding existing user "{{ item }}" to group syscontrol
    user:
      name: "{{ item }}"
      groups: syscontrol
      append: yes
    with_items:
    - deadlineuser
    - centos
    become: true
